# Differential Machine Learning
Tensorflow and Pytorch implementation of differential machine learning (https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.02347, by Brian Huge and Antoine Savine).

Differential Machine Learning (DML) is a regularization technique for neural networks that leverages the availability of derivatives of the training labels with respect to the training inputs. Those derivatives are called differential labels. DML forces the derivative of the neural network to be close to the differential labels.
